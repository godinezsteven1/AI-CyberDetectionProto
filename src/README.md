Initially Created: Tuesday, October 22nd 2024 12:07am, <br> 
The main Idea of this project is to initialize my experience with AI in java 
using ML learning tools like WEKA, an API and essentially create a Cybernetic
Threat Detection System. The focus will be on network anomolies, MLM and maybe some 
reinforcement learning once I expand my horizons within AI. <Br>

Weka dependency being used <br>
I had a few issues with maven and weka dependency, Which is why you will see 
the lib folder I had them initialized as jars but just used deeplearning4j-core instead

installed MangoDb locally for blocked IPs
